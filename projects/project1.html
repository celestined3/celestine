      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>For my Bachelor's degree dissertation, I chose to do a project involving designing a foldable horn antenna as part of a radio telescope system. My main focus was understanding the restrictions imposed on the design due to the harsh space environment and modelling a panel in Solidworks to analyse the effects of design considerations through simulation.</p>
      <p>Throughout this project, I gained invaluable report writing skills, as well as developing my LaTeX and Solidworks skills tremendously. My favourite part of this project (other than finally achieving simulation results in Solidworks!) was reading about other people's work during my literature review. Discovering niche, high-level research was really inspiring and made me excited for the future of space engineering.</p>
      <p>During the report write up, I had the privilege to present this project to my professors, friends and industry experts - a great networking event at The University of Manchester.</p>
