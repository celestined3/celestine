      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>For this project, I worked with a team of engineers to re-design TechDemoSat-1, focusing on sustainability, systems integration and an improved concept of operations. I was the payload engineer and you can find my individual report for the payload subsystem below.</p>
      <p>This project taught me how to think like an engineer and highlighted just how complicated and intricate space missions can be. It was particularly difficult to integrate all subsystems because we were developing a platform to house payloads, rather than working on power and mass budgets for just one specific payload. I managed to get a taste of what working in industry might be like and that's what makes this project one of my favourites!</p>
