        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Celestine, a 4th year Aerospace Engineering student at The University of Manchester specialising in Space.</p>
        <p>I am an aspiring payload engineer and would love a career in the space industry. This page tells you a bit about who I am.</p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I was born in Toronto, Canada, moved to the UK in 2014 at 10 years old and am proud to hold both Canadian and British passports, as well as Turkish citizenship. My academic journey has focused on aerodynamics, spacecraft structures and deployable mechanisms. I first realised that engineering was the career for me at school in my first Design & Technology lesson at the age of 11. I was lucky enough to have an experienced teacher who showed me how engineers think and see the world - he challenged me to view simple everyday objects around me as solutions to a problem.</p> 
      <p>Since then, I have been committed to learning and developing my design skills, especially for space related applications. In my final year at university, I have chosen to specialise in the Space stream of units because that industry really intrigues me.</p>
      <p>There is still so much we don't know about space and I feel that a career in this field is well suited to me because its unknown aspect will allow me to grow through being creative and adapting to change. As technology advances, engineering becomes more exciting and contributing to valuable future space missions is a dream of mine.</p>

      <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
      <p>Outside of engineering, playing netball is what keeps me grounded. I absolutely love the teamwork aspect of this sport and feel recharged every time I play. I gained more than just having fun from netball, it has taught me communication, resilience and how to adapt quickly to change. I have played for the engineering team at The University of Manchester for my entire time at university and am so grateful for that experience.</p>
      <p>I also enjoy running (link to my Strava) and creating engineering projects to do in my spare time (these are sprinkled throughout this website).</p>
